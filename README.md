# Hello-world

Hello everyone!! This is Haejin Green and I am so excited to start a new journey of my life!!
I have been working at Travel Industry over 10 years and I really wanted to change my career to devlope my self to next step.
As an full-time wroking mom, I always think that I need to get a better job to support my family because of cost of living these days.
It's been really hard time for everyone due to pandemic situation, it is what it is.. so, I would like to think this situation to positive way.
It's time to learn and improve myself so, I have decided to start a join a soft engineering program.
Hope everyone get through this course and become a soft engineer together!!
Thank you!!
